# Python-Sorting-Algorithms

## Overview
This project does X.

## Section 1
### Part 1
This file showcases very particular implementations of MergeSort and Insertion-Sort, comparing their performance in a series of tests.  Each algorithm is first tested on randomly filled, unsorted arrays of sizes between 100 and 10000, with a step size of 250.  The algorithms are then tested under the same set of conditions, except that the lists are already sorted.

Results are provided in "Section1/Reporting/", including both the raw performance data in "graphs.xlsx", as well as graphs showing their growth rates in the "Image" folder.  The files "chart1" and "chart2" state the order of time required to run various different algorithms.

### Part 2
This file showcases two different solutions to the maximum subarray problem.  One solution uses recursion, along with a helper function, and is able to solve the problem in time order NlogN.  The other solution is a brute-force method that utilizes nested "for" loops, where the outer loop iterates through all possible starting indices and the inner loop iterates through all the possible ending indices.

Each solution is tested by measuring the amount of time it takes to solve lists of sizes between 100 and 10000, randomly filled with numbers between -1000 and 1000, and with a step size of 500.

Results are once again provided in "Section1/Reporting/", including performance data and growth rates.
